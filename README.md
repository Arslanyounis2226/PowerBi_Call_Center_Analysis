# PwC Virtual Internship Dashboard Project

## Background
During my virtual internship program with PwC on the Forage platform, I was tasked with creating a dynamic and insightful dashboard in Power BI for Claire, reflecting a range of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics from the dataset provided. This internship opportunity allowed me to delve into real-world data analysis and visualization challenges, enhancing my skills and knowledge in the field.

## Skills and Tools Used
- **Data Analysis**: Leveraging advanced data analysis techniques to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
- **Data Visualization**: Employing Power BI to create compelling visualizations that communicate complex information effectively.
- **Dashboard Design**: Designing an intuitive and user-friendly dashboard interface to facilitate easy interpretation of the data.
- **Problem Solving**: Tackling challenges in data manipulation and visualization to deliver actionable insights for decision-making.

## Findings
The dashboard I developed encompasses a variety of essential KPIs, including but not limited to:
1. **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: Visualizing customer feedback scores and ratings to gauge the satisfaction level.
2. **Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned**: Tracking the volume of calls handled by the customer service team and those that were abandoned.
3. **Calls by Time**: Analyzing call distribution throughout the day to identify peak hours and optimize staffing.
4. **Average Speed of Answer**: Displaying the average time taken to answer calls, ensuring efficient customer service.
5. **Agentâ€™s Performance Quadrant**: Utilizing a quadrant chart to compare agents based on their average handle time (talk duration) and calls answered, highlighting top performers and areas for improvement.

## Conclusion
This project has significantly enhanced my proficiency in data visualization and analysis using Power BI, while also sharpening my ability to translate complex data into meaningful insights. I am grateful for the opportunity to work on this engaging task during my virtual internship with PwC and am excited to apply the skills and knowledge gained in future endeavors.

Special thanks to the Forage platform for facilitating this valuable learning experience. I look forward to leveraging these skills to drive data-driven decision-making and contribute effectively to future projects.
